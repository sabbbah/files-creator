A simple command-line Python tool to create multiple files based on user input. You can specify file names, extensions, and target directory paths. This tool will also prompt you if a file with the same name already exists, giving you the option to overwrite it.

## Features

- **Multiple File Creation**: Easily create multiple files by entering their names separated by commas.
- **Custom File Extensions**: Choose the file extension (e.g., `.txt`, `.php`, `.js`) for your files.
- **File Existence Check**: Automatically checks if a file already exists and prompts for overwriting if needed.
- **Directory Targeting**: Specify the target directory where files will be created.
- **Colorized Output**: Uses ANSI escape codes to display beautiful colorized messages in the terminal.

## Preview

2. Follow the on-screen prompts:
   - Enter the file names separated by commas (e.g., `file1, file2, file3`).
   - Enter the file extension (e.g., `txt`, `php`, `js`).
   - Provide the target directory path (e.g., `/path/to/directory`).
   - If a file already exists, you'll be asked whether to overwrite it.
